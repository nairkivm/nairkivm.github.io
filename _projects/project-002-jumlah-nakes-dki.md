This project is similar project with [project #001](https://nairkivm.github.io/projects/project-001-european-history-viewer), but it's more simple and straightforward. I've made a dashboard that contains a _filter view_ and a simple line chart that shows the numbers of medical workes in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The source of this project is [Open Data Jakarta](https://data.jakarta.go.id/dataset/jumlahtenagakesehatandkijakarta) that contains the datasets from 2007-2020.

Actually, this project can be made simpler using _Slice_ and _Pivot Table_ for the _filter view_. But, I think using native-only formulas is more customizable and user-friendly.
