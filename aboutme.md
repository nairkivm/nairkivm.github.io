My name is **nairkivm** (_Fikri Aulyanor_ is just a code name!). I learned Astronomy at the college and I love science. It's so cool. Look how cool are **Big Bang** and **Black Holes**! Look how cool is my favourite scientist [_Hououin Kyouma_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ68yGO5f-o) the "Mad Scientist" (lol, just kidding!).

Anyway, my job is anything related to data, the main ingredient of science. I do data analysis and data engineering, and I aspire to be a good data scientist or an AI researcher in the future (I wish someone would make something like [_Amadeus AI_](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Amadeus_System) in the future, lol!)

PS : I'm not that nerd, really! No cap, I'm 100% funny and chill!
