My name is nairkivm (_Fikri Aulyanor_ is just a code name!). I learned Astronomy at the college and I love science. It's so cool. Look how cool are Big Bang and Black Holes! Look how cool is my favourite scientist [_Hououin Kyouma_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ68yGO5f-o) the "Mad Scientist" (lol, just kidding!).

Anyway, my job is anything related to data, the main ingredient of science. I do data analysis and data engineering, and I aspire to be a good data scientist or an AI researcher in the future. In the end of my lifetime, I hope that I contributed something useful for humanity!

PS : I'm not that nerd, really! Belive me, I'm 100% funny and chill!
