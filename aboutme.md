My name is **nairkivm** a.k.a _Fikri Aulyanor_. I learned Astronomy at the college and I love science. It's so cool. Look how cool are **Big Bang** and **Black Holes**! Look how cool is my favourite scientist [_Hououin Kyouma_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ68yGO5f-o) the "Mad Scientist" (lol, just kidding!).

Anyway, my job is anything related to data. I do data analysis and data engineering. I'm interested in data sceince and AI (I wish someone would make something like [_Amadeus AI_](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Amadeus_System) in the future, lol!)
